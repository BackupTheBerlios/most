/// Configuration and handling of PIT.

/// !Usage
///
/// -# Initialize System timer for a period in ï¿½second with

/// -# Set the PIT Periodic Interval Value with PIT_SetPIV
/// -# Enable the PIT with PIT_Enable
/// -# Enable & disable PIT interrupts using PIT_EnableInt and
///    PIT_DisableInt
/// -# Read PIT mode register
///    PIT_GetMode
/// -# Read PIT status register
///    PIT_GetStatus
/// -# Read PIT CPIV and PICNT without ressetting the counters
///    PIT_GetPIIR
/// -# Read System timer CPIV and PICNT without ressetting the counters
///    PIT_GetPIVR
