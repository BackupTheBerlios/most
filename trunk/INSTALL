============

There are a lot of makefiles:
for building the objects, libraries, bsp and programms.

The main makefile in the trunk folder calls the makefiles
for libraries and programms and these call makefiles for the objects.

You can build all, a programm, just a library or just some objects.

The common makefiles are placed in etc and you should not use them directly.
