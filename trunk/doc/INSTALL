1.) Setup.
==========

A description for the setup you will find on http://most.berlios.de/ .

A short description:

Set MOST_ROOT environment variable to the root directory of the MOST project (trunk folder).
This can be done with the command "source ROOT" in the trunk folder if the project is checked out
with the name trunk.

Setup the Config files (Copy Copy_2_Config to Config and edit it to your needs)
in trunk/etc/Config and trunk/bsp/board/Config.


2.) Build.
==========

Just call "make all" in the trunk folder to build the libraries and binary.
Use "make help" to see all build targets!
There are a lot of Makefiles in subdirectories to build subparts, use "make help" to see the possible targets.


3.) How the build system works.
===============================

The common makefiles are placed in the mostroot/etc folder and you should not use them directly, 
they are called from the other makefiles.

There are a lot of makefiles:
for building the objects, libraries, bsp and programs.

The main makefile in the trunk folder calls the makefiles
for building the libraries and programs and these call makefiles for building the objects.

The file system works as project manager, this means
the makefile to build the objects will build all objects for the source files
which are placed in the sub folder src. To add a source file just place it in the source folder.
The built objects are placed in the o folder, the dependencies are placed in the d folder and 
if you build the asm files (make asm) they are placed in the s folder.
Assembler source files are placed like: src/$MOST_CPU/name.S .

You can build all, a program, just a library or just some objects by using the appropriate
Makefile.
