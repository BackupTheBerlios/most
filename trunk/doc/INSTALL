1.) Checkout the MOST trunk.
============================

2.) Setup.
==========

As host actually only linux x386 is supported.

As target actually a board with H83003 is supported.
For crosscompiling you need to extract the compiler tool chain
package in the trunk folder. I didn check in the compiler tool
chain to the repository, if you need it i can send it per email(2,5MB).


2.1.) Commandline and editor(emacs):
------------------------------------

To setup the environment type at commandline in the "trunk" folder: 
"source etc/Settings.env" for each shell.

2.2.) Eclipse:
--------------

Install the C/C++ Plugin
Import the Project:
File->Import->General->Excisting Project into Workspace
Change variable MOST_ROOT in the projects environment to your needs. 

3.) Compile.
============

There are a lot of makefiles:
for building the objects, libraries, bsp and programms.

The main makefile in the trunk folder calls the makefiles
for libraries and programms and these call makefiles for the objects.

You can build all, a programm, just a library or just some objects.

The common makefiles are placed in etc and you should not use them directly.

	Makefile   (all)
	sys/src>
			Makefile (sys libs)

				Makefile (ace lib)
				stdio>
					Makefile (objects)

	usr/...
	bsp/mdc/sys/src>
					Makefile (bsp objects)
					...
			usr/boot/
					Makefile (prog, bin, srec)
					src/ (Application)
					

3.1.) Commandline:
------------------

Type "make" or "make help" to get more information.

3.2.) Eclipse:
--------------

Project->Build
Project->Clean
Project->Build make target 
 
4.) Download.
Have a look to the board support package as example.
Actually the download works with serial cable (binary),
or ethernet with bootp and tftp.
