VERSION = V-0.1.0-d-7 : commit
=====================

DATE = 07.09.2013
AUTOR = maik

STATE = compileable and running, SAM7_EX256 board is broken(pluged EXT connector wrong and got +5V to GND and +3,3V to reset,
        boot from flash does not work and some other (reset, pwm ?) seems to be broken.) :(. 

ADD = bsp/la2 adc, pwm, flash support, bootloader is now working (only with y-modem, eth still missing)
      bsp/la2/usr/test line following robot(in development)
      bsp/mdc   HW random number generator
      usr/dpy   LCD character display
      usr/sen   create library for sensors
      usr/act   create liberty for actors
      
FIX = check size of bin file (if it fits to reserved flash region) as the linker script check only the size of the text segment
      but the bin file is the text segment (text, rodata) concatenated with the data segment.
      Also increased the reserved flash size for the bootloader (mdc: putboot = 64k, boot = 128k, app = 320k,
      sam: boot = 80k, app = 176k, la2: boot = 128k, app = 896k), for you the size of the bootloader may be to big but
      for me currently it is ok as i am interested in development and don't need a small bootloader for a special purpose.
      Also the object files from the bsp/sys (arch/init) are defined in the application Makefile explicit and independently,
      as the applications may need different objects. So the size of the binary can be reduced
      (gcc links all defined objects to the binary even if they are not used,
      (this is not valid for the objects from the static libraries) ). 


VERSION = V-0.1.0-d-6 : labeled (V-0-1-0-d-6)
=====================

DATE = 16.06.2013
AUTOR = maik

STATE =compileable and running

ADD =bsp/la2 (support Olimex board SAM7-LA2),
     bsp/pc  (suport ibmpc only in Qemu)
     dev/arch/ibmpc (ibmpc architecture)
     dev/arch/at91sam7a2 (AT91SAM7-A2 architecture)

FIX =moved dev/arch/at91 to dev/arch/at91sam7x
     moved dev/arch/h8 to  dev/arch/h83003



VERSION = V-0.1.0-d-4 : labeled (V-0-1-0-d-4)
=====================

DATE = 12.01.2013
AUTOR = maik

STATE = SAM : compilable and running
        MDC : compilable and running
        open, close directory function may be not convenient to walk through the directory tree,
        maybe introduce a walk function?
        
ADD =   ymodem receive,
        different build directories for run and debug binaries,
        add Config file for each application,
        <build all> just builds the configured application,
        generate function sections and remove unused sections (configurable),
        cleanup mfs/vfs and add block device interface,
        cli/add pipe and stdio redirection,
        add serial receive timeout,
        serial, tty  IO control function and CTRL-D, 
        axfr receive and send files,
        SAM watchdog enabled,
        SAM user reset ? acctually polled in run_led,
        just one download mechanism for updating bootloader and application:
        download is now a block device, it can be written by tftp_g and ym_r,
        ls command and MFS_resolve(path),

FIX=    SAM for start_Appliction, start_Bootloader -> do remap because remap toggles the memmory mapping,
        io_spi CS 


VERSION = V-0.1.0-d-3 : labeled (V-0-1-0-d-3)
=====================

DATE = 23.06.2012
AUTOR = maik

STATE = SAM : compilable and running
        MDC : compilable and running (serial eeprom does not work)
        
ADD = ACE DEV: time, rtc,
	  BSP: Audio out(beep),
	  NAP: Syslog client
	  ACE BSP: ASSERT, PANIC 
	  CHANGELOG file
	  Ubuntu OpenOCD 0.5.0	
	  GDB support for Eclipse
	  Build structure improvements
	  tty to handle CR/LF conversion
	  Doxygen: just one doc folder for all sys-, one for all usr -libraries
	  rename Makefiles.* all do Makefile so that editors can handle tabs (instead of spaces)
	  error headers with error constant definitions
      io_spi for serial eeprom(not working correct, cs has do be done)
	  
FIX = NET: error in emac sending (only one netbuf was transmitted)
