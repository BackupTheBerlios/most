This README file describes the MOST release.
Comments, questions, and bug reports are always welcome.

MOST is a collection of libraries and board support packages
to provide an operating system for embedded systems.
They are linked together with the the application.
The goal is to develope a small, clean and simple os wich runs on
microcontrollers without mmu and to provide
a plattform for embedded development.   

MOST features:
	* a collection of standard ansi c functions
	* multithreading, inter process communication, memmory management
	* device drivers for serial port, timers, digital io.
	* commandline interpreter for interaction and debugging. 
    * udp/ip networking (tcp has do be done).
	* network protocols bootp, tftp (others have to be done).
    * board support packages and bootloaders (actualy only h83003).
	* api documentation generated with doxygen(in work).
	
MOST is freely avaliable under the LGPL license(see COPYING).
MOST must allways be free and there is no commercial version.
The applications which are linked with MOST can be commercial.

MOST is in development and has some(maybe more) bugs,
but it is useable on my board.
I am looking for help to design and hack the OS, port it to other architectures,
write board support packages and to write documentation.
