Board support package for an old board which was used in the beginning of the MOST development.
================================================================================================
This board does not support jtag, but it may serve as basis for other old boards which do not support jtag.

Applications:
putboot:just do be safe if the bootloader is destroyed so that it can be restored without taking out the flash.
        take out the flash from the socket and put it an external programmer (i use a batronix),
        programm the putboot.bin to the flash and put the flash back to the socket.
        use version 0-1-0-d-4 or higher since that version ymodem is used for downloading the bootloader,
        older version will not work correctly for larger files.
boot: bootloader for downloading the application via y-modem or tftp
frame: a frame for building new applications, the applications may be able to update the bootloader
       since the bootloader can not update himself.
test: test application

This board and also the h83003 microcontroller is just supported poorly.
