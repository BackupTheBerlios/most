Board support package for an IBM compatible PC, just Qemu is supported!
=======================================================================
Thanks to the lowlevel tutorial (http://www.lowlevel.eu/wiki/Hauptseite)
Using the lowlevel tutorial i ported freoMOST to a PC emulated by Qemu.
This is very rudimental.

Applications:
kernel: just multithreaded kernel with command line interpreter
        todo support for processes (mmu) , sys interface, drivers and applications in userspace
        build binaries and run in ./kernel/debug "qemu -kernel kernel.elf"
        with "klog +" increase the log level two times (PROTOCOL) and than you will see the printed letters
        by some running threads.
